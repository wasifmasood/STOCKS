Here are a few techniques that I have used to predict stock prices/percentage change. I continously explore new methods and techniques and share my results. Therefore, this work package is a living document.

In addition to main models such as XGBoost, FBProphet and Gaussian Process Regression, I am using the TA-lib which provides functions for technical analysis. It is a very practice lib for measure several technical trends such as momentum, volatility, cycle, etc. Here is the detailed link for installation https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/install.html
