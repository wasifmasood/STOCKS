    "##### Cross validation in time series is more challenging as the usual methods of random split is not applicable here. To keep the time structure of a time series consistent, we need to successively break the data into train and validation sets. There are several customized methods out there but I particularly admire the one with the use of 'gap'. In addition to keeping the time structure consistent, a gap of certain time unit is introduced to between the train and the validation set. Here is the implementation of such method. A very detailed article on cross validation in time series can be found here https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4"
